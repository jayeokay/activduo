# activduo

The activduo project introduces a duo service that includes a new concept that 1. integrates activbody's force sensors with data-driven models into daily routines and 2. allows activbody's products to connect to additional devices such as smart watches.

## 1. Integrating cutting-edge technology into everyday use
activglov uses layered Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) to measure force through variable resistance. Attached to the glove would be microprocessors and BLE that would transmit data collected by the force sensors to the already existing smart phone application.

### The future of activglov
In the future, we hope to add features such as a flexible battery storage in the glove. In theory, this battery storage would track the lifetime of activglov and would notify the user when the battery is at a low percentage.

## 2. Connecting activbody products to smart watches
Our code would use the Activ5 SDK to modify the already existing activbody application so that the application could be installed in a smart watch, making it easier for users to track their progress during workouts without having to refer back to their phones inbetween rounds exercise.

### The future of the Activ5 app
We hope to implement a new game that would be more compatible with the way smart watches can display information. The screen would show the target circumference of a circle. Before the workout begins, the user would start out from the center of the circle. As the user adds pressure or force, the center would begin to expand and will continue to do in relation to how much the user is increasing their strength. We would also implement a vibrating feature that would help the user know how close they are to the target circumference. This is to account for the fact that certain exercises require body positions where the user would not be able to physically see their watches, for example having their arms stretch behind them. They can rely on the vibration to know how much harder they would have to push or release in order to get their circle to match the target circumference.
